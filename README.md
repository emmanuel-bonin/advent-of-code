Yearly Advent Calendar

Daily puzzles coming from [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/).

I could not decide which language to use, so I used different ones across the years and days.

## 2023

Mostly in Python, sometimes C++ or JS.

Could not resolve every puzzles, but I tried to do as much as I could.

## 2024

Will try to do 1 language per day (will be JS, TS or Python if I struggle too much).

As I already did JS twice, 23 languages remain.
